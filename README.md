Sundry reusable scraps of C for computational biology

Small bits of code ready to drop into a new application. I prefer lightweight
code development whenever practical. Having reusable chunks handy for inclusion
in a new codebase just seems preferable sometimes.

In that spirit I'm indebted to good folks like [Troy D.
Hanson](http://troydhanson.github.io/) and [Joe
Walnes](https://github.com/joewalnes).
